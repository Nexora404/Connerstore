    <p class="asidetext">
      in <strong>2025</strong> we  made an improvment in our complition rate as compared to the year 2024.
      <br>
      <br> 
      In 2024 we had a <strike>84</strike> percentage complete rate which was not good . The completion rate is 
      expected to go up due to improvments in our services 
      <br>
      According to the chart <i>which was hard to make</i> we copmleted more than 90 percentage of the oders we got.
      canceled oders were due to miss press or ammatures playing with the web . 
      <br> <br> 
      Not <strong>completed</strong> oders were due to people miss filling oders or wrong submittion methods. 
      also unlnown locations leads to us failing to deliver to those locations .
